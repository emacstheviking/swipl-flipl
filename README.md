# SWIPL FLIPL -- Code / Test flipper.

This little extension will allow you to bind a key to a function
called `swipl-flipl` that simple, cleanly and very very naively finds
the file that is the dual of your current file in that if you are
editing the source file (*.pl) it will open the corresponding test
script (*.plt) file using the base filename as the stem.

## What it does

If you don't have a test script yet....it will open a file on a new
buffer for you as that's the standard Emacs behaviour when trying to
find a file that doesn't yet exist. Nothing to do with me but
nonetheless helpful :)

## Installation

Paste the code into your .emacs file and then bind a key like this:

    (add-hook 'prolog-mode-hook
          (lambda ()
            (local-set-key "\C-ct" 'swipl-flipl)))

That's Ctrl-C t, t for test or toggle or time-for-tea.

Of course, if you want to keep it separate etc then that's your
call. A mans .emacs file is his castle after all. (And that includes
ladies too of course, I didn't invent that expression).

## Issues, Requests etc.

Raise an issue. It has a few rough edges and quite soon I think I may
have to make it a bit smarter about using an existing visible frame
that may alreay have the "other" file in it as it currently uses
default behaviours. I'd rather it flipped frames to the already
visible file...feel free to contribute.
